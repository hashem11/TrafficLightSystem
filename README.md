#TrafficLightSystem
==================

An embedded system for simulated traffic light intersection was built in this project. The traffic light system was conceived as a finite state machine (FSM) which was converted into C code (using an indexed addressed data structure and memory-mapped I/O). The program was run on the Tiva TM4C123G Launchpad microcontroller. A manual (pdf) for the Launchpad has been added to the project page. The code for program is present in TableTrafficLight.c in the TrafficLight_files folder.  The Keil ÂµVision Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was used for this project. The link for the system design description (which includes the FSM state transition table) can be found below.
