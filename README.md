#TrafficLightSystem
==================

An embedded system for a simulated traffic light intersection.

An embedded system for simulated traffic light intersection was built in this project. The traffic light system was conceived as a finite state machine (FSM) which was converted into C code (using an indexed addressed data structure and memory-mapped I/O). The program was run on the Tiva TM4C123G Launchpad microcontroller.
